# ⚠️ IMPORTANT - Clear Browser Cache

The dashboard has been updated with all fixes, but you may be seeing errors from cached files.

## To Fix:

### Option 1: Hard Refresh (RECOMMENDED)
1. Open http://localhost:3000 in your browser
2. Press **Ctrl + Shift + Delete** (or Cmd + Shift + Delete on Mac)
3. Select "Cached images and files"
4. Click "Clear data"
5. Refresh the page

### Option 2: Incognito/Private Window
1. Open a new Incognito/Private browser window
2. Navigate to http://localhost:3000

### Option 3: Different Browser
Try opening http://localhost:3000 in a different browser (Edge, Firefox, Chrome, etc.)

## Verification
All Gantt charts now use `dateFormat YYYY-MM-DD` format.
The negative rect width errors are fixed in the code - you just need a fresh browser session to see the changes.
